```julia
RectangularBox(start, stop)
```

yields a neighborhood which is a rectangular (Cartesian) box defined by the
bounds of the multi-dimensional indices in the box.

Another possibility is to specify the dimensions of the box and the offsets of
its central element:

```julia
RectangularBox(dims, offs)
```

with `dims` a `N`-tuple of dimensions and `offs` either a `N`-tuple of indices
of an instance of `CartesianIndex{N}`.

A `RectangularBox` can also be defined by the index ranges along all the
dimensions.  For example:

```julia
RectangularBox(-3:3, 0, -2:1)
RectangularBox((-3:3, 0, -2:1))

```

both yield a 3-dimensional `RectangularBox` of size `7×1×4` and whose first
index varies on `-3:3`, its second index is `0` while its third index varies on
`-2:1`.

Finally, a `RectangularBox` can be defined as:

```julia
RectangularBox(R)
```

where `R` is an instance of `CartesianIndices` or, on version of Julia ≤ 0.6,
`CartesianRange`.

    # this is what we store.

"""

A `Kernel` can be used to define a weighted neighborhood (for weighted local
average or for convolution) or a structuring element (for mathematical
morphology).  It is a rectangular array of coefficients over a, possibly
off-centered, rectangular neighborhood.  In general, it is sufficient to
specify `::Kernel{T,N}` in the signature of methods, with `T` the type of the
coefficients and `N` the number of dimensions (the third parameter `A` of the
type is to fully qualify the type of the array of coefficients).

A kernel is built as:

```julia
B = Kernel([T,] C, start=defaultstart(C))
```

where `C` is the array of coefficients (which can be retrieved by `coefs(B)`)
and `start` the initial `CartesianIndex` for indexing the kernel (which can be
retrieved by `initialindex(B)`).  The `start` parameter let the caller choose
an arbitrary origin for the kernel coefficients; when a filter is applied, the
following mapping is assumed:

```julia
B[k] ≡ C[k + off]
```

where `off = initialindex(C) - initialindex(B)`.

If `start` is omitted, its value is set so that the *origin* (whose index is
`zero(CartesianIndex{N})` with `N` the number of dimensions) of the kernel
indices is at the geometric center of the array of coefficients (see
[`LocalFilters.defaultstart`](@ref)).  Optional argument `T` is to impose the
type of the coefficients.

To convert the element type of the coefficients of an existing kernel, do:

```julia
Kernel(T, K)
```

which yields a kernel whose coefficients are those of the kernel `K`
converted to type `T`.

It is also possible to convert instances of [`RectangularBox`](@ref) into a
kernel with boolean coefficients by calling:

```julia
Kernel(B)
```

where `B` is the neighborhood to convert into an instance of `Kernel`.
